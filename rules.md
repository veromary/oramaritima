<a name="footnote1"></a> **1** a is used for ab before a consonant. 

'Order of Words, Rule i. — Put the Adjective immediately AFTEH 
its Noun. The English order is just the opposite ; thus where English says 
•a pretty house,' Latin says 'a house pretty' ; where English says 'the sea- 
shore ' or ' the maritime shore' Latin says 'the shore maritime.' This rule 
applies also to Possessive Adjectives, like 'my,' 'your,' 'his,' 'our,' 
'their': thus where English says 'my aunt' Latin siys 'aunt mine.' But 
the rule does not apply to Adjectives used with the verb ' to be,' as in ' the 
country-house is pretty ' or ' how pretty the country-house is I ' 


•Order of Words, Rule 2.— Put the Adverb BEFORE the Verb or 
other word v/hioh it qualifies. The English order is often different ; thus 
where English says 'sings well' Latin says 'well sings.' English may say 
' sings sometimes ' or ' sometimes sings,' but Latin always says ' sometimes 
Dings.' This rule applies to the Adverb non, which must always come 
immedialily before the word which it negatives ; and it also applies to 
Adverbial phrases formed with Prepositions, such as ' far from the sea-shore ', 
' under the shade of the chestnut-tree ' ; thus for ' the nightingale sings under 
the shade of the chestnut-tree' say ' the nightingale under the sliade of the 
chestnut-tree sings '.
