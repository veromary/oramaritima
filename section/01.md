<a name="footnote1"></a> **1** *a* is used for *ab* before a consonant. 

**2** Order of Words, Rule 1. — **Put the Adjective immediately AFTER 
its Noun.** The English order is just the opposite ; thus where English says 
'a pretty house,' Latin says 'a house pretty' ; where English says 
'the sea-shore' or 'the maritime shore' 
Latin says 'the shore maritime.' This rule 
applies also to Possessive Adjectives, like 'my,' 'your,' 'his,' 'our,' 
'their': thus where English says 'my aunt' Latin says 'aunt mine.' But 
the rule does not apply to Adjectives used with the verb 'to be,' as in 'the 
country-house is pretty' or 'how pretty the country-house is I' 


**3** Order of Words, Rule 2.— **Put the Adverb BEFORE the Verb or 
other word which it qualifies.** The English order is often different ; thus 
where English says 'sings well' Latin says 'well sings.' English may say 
' sings sometimes ' or ' sometimes sings,' but Latin always says ' sometimes 
Dings.' This rule applies to the Adverb non, which must always come 
immedialily before the word which it negatives ; and it also applies to 
Adverbial phrases formed with Prepositions, such as ' far from the sea-shore ', 
' under the shade of the chestnut-tree ' ; thus for ' the nightingale sings under 
the shade of the chestnut-tree' say ' the nightingale under the sliade of the 
chestnut-tree sings '. 

**4** Questions may be asked in conversational Latin, as in English, simply by 
changine; the tone of the voice, and without any interrogative particle ; e.g. 
'vis pugnare?' you want to fight? (Plautus, Rudens ion). This is very 
common in Plautus and Terence. But it is easy to introduce the particle 
'-ne' to the pupil from the first, if the teacher prefers ; e.g. Habitatne 
ancilla in villa?
