Ora Maritima is a Latin text from 1908.

You can download a pretty good scanned copy [from the Internet Archive here](https://archive.org/details/cu31924031202850).  If you have access to a proper computer with command line tools like pdfjam and pdfbook you can set it up to print ready to comb bind.

You can hear the story read aloud by [Evan der Millner (Mollendarius)](http://latinum.org.uk):

There's even a [sequel called Pro Patria](https://archive.org/details/cu31924031167160)

It would be ideal if only it had an Answer Key and resources like that.

So, let's see if I can work my way through the book and compile some sort of Answer Key and any other helps along the way to make this a slightly easier option for self-learners and homeschoolers and crazy people who like working through Latin textbooks.

An endorsement from the adverts at the end of the book:

> Ora Maritima does for Latin what the modern oral methods do for French and German, i.e., it makes the beginner realize that the language is really a vehicle o expression, whereby commonsense notions can be conveyed. From personal experience I can testify how a few weeks are sufficient to gain this all-important idea; and it is worth adding that in a school which I have recently inspected a small boy of eleven employed his leisure time in working through Ora Maritima to the end and then came to his master for the sequel, Pro Patria. There was no need to tell that boy that Latin is something more than a phalanx of declinable nouns and verbs.â€”Alfred Hughes, M.A., Organising Professor of Education in the University of Birmingham.

Wish me luck!
